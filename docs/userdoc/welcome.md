# User documentation

:::caution
**Work in progress!** Come back soon - user documentation almost complete. 
:::

Welcome to the generatedata.com user documentation! The purpose of this section is to explain what the application does, 
how to install it, and provide a little history on the script.   

Also note that the production website for this script ([generatedata.com](https://generatedata.com)) is a private
fork of this repo. They're very similar, but it does contain a few additions that you won't see in this script. See
the [website doc](./about/website.md) page for more info on that.

:::tip
1. For info on how to *use* the application, see the in-app help. In the footer there's a "Take a tour" option to give
you a good overview of the application as a whole. Also, after selecting a Data Type, click the help icon next on the row
to learn more about what it offers. You'll be able to browse the full doc for all Data Types there.
2. For day-to-day updates on what's going on with the script, see the [github issues](https://github.com/benkeen/generatedata/issues)
section.
3. For the list of what's changed, see the [changelog](https://github.com/benkeen/generatedata/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md).
4. For developers interested in learning about the script, see the Developer Doc section.
