# 3.x doc

Since Sept 2021, the 3.x version of generatedata.com - written in PHP and MySQL - has been archived and replaced 
with v4, which was a complete rewrite in React, Redux, Node, GraphQL, MySQL and Docker. As of Nov 2021, the 3.x website
has been archived and is now only available for users who had signed up for user accounts. The site will remaining running
for several years, but no-one can sign up for it any more. Time to move onto the new (much improved) version!

The 3.x versions are still available for download on [github here](https://github.com/benkeen/generatedata/releases). The
old documentation has been [archived here](https://benkeen.github.io/generatedata3/).
