# Prerequisites

1. You'll need at least 10-15GB free. I know. Docker is a real hog.  
2. [Download and install Docker Desktop](https://docs.docker.com/desktop).

:::info
**What is Docker?**
Docker is a popular platform for shipping and running self-contained applications. Rather than requiring you to install
numerous different tools and applications on your own machine and keep them up to date, Docker "containerizes" them and
lets you forget about the details of an application.

3. Download the latest version of generatedata. 
4. [Install node](https://nodejs.org/en). 
5. Install nvm. 
- Open up `Terminal`.
- Follow the instructions here. 

6. Install yarn.
```
npm install --global yarn
```


And that's it! Now let's install it.
