# Installation

Alrighty! Let's get this sucker installed. 

This section outlines how to install and configure the script on your local computer. And yup, if you want it running
on your local intranet or what have you, that's no problem either. 

:::caution
Even though we're using Docker, the script isn't fully dockerized yet. So the installation process *does* require installing
a number of additional scripts locally besides just Docker. If anyone's interested in helping improve this I'd love to
hear from you! Chime in on github issues or reach out to me at ben.keen@gmail.com.

:::caution
Second caution! These instructions are really for Mac. It should run in a very comparable was on Windows but if you have
any problems I would suggest [raising an issue](https://github.com/benkeen/generatedata/issues) and asking for help. If
there are genuine Windows-related problems I'll try to reproduce and patch.
