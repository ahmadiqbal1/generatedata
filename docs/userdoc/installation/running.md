1. Make a copy the `.env.default` file and call it `.env`. 
2. Update that file. Instructions
3. run `yarn startAndBuildDevServer`
4. Wait. And then wait some more. It will appear to freeze at several points, e.g. this one:

At this point, the server is started. 

4. In a separate tab, run `yarn start`
